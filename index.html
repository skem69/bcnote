      <p>First of all, this site took under 3 minutes to make, apart from the time that I spent writing this, so apologies for the 'uglyness'. I'd like to thank you for taking time out of your day to come and read this, I assume most people won't. A small part of me admires you for going through the effort to find the source of said shirt, it must mean you like it so thank you for that. :) Now onto the part of me talking about you stealing my clothing. Honestly I could give less of a fuck that you steal my clothes, however It's quite annoying as I value this group ALOT. If you're gonna steal my clothing and re-upload it, could you atleast point people to Based Clothing and be a nice guy about it, if not then I'll just DMCA you lol. But you might aswell buy the clothes straight from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/16430265/b-sed-clothing#!/about" target="_blank">Based Clothing</a> as it costs 10 R$ to upload, but only 7 R$ from us, but I'm sure you knew that aha. Anyway, since you like the clothing I produce then always feel free to hit me up, I'll always be happy to hear out any business opportunites you have, I won't put my Discord here due to the fact that I might change it, but you'll always be able to find my updated socials via <a href="https://skem.ml" target="_blank">skem.ml</a>. Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day! (p.s, I logged your IP and you're getting DDOSED for stealing my clothes, just kidding!)</p>
    <h1>TLDR;</h1>
    <p>I don't give a shit if you steal my clothes and re-upload them, just give me credit or I'll DMCA you, also it's cheaper to buy from us than to upload yourself!</p>
